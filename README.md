# SalesInsightsUsingPowerBI
Gathered insights on the sales of a company and visualized the results using MySQL and Power BI.
The project is inspired from the YouTube playlist titled 'Data Analysis Projects' by the channel codebasics.

# Tools Used
- MySQL Workbench
- Power BI Desktop

# Steps Followed

## Step 1 : Imported Target Database
The database on which analysis needs to be done was imported into the MySQL Workbench. The data was imported from a SQL Text File named db_dump.

## Step 2 : Data Analysis Using SQL
In this step, the data imported from db_dump was analyzed using SQL commands on the Workbench. 
The main objective of this step was to get a feel of the data. Some of the major things done in this step were - FInding the count of the number of sales in the transactions table,
Analyzing the number of transactions in different currencies, Performing join methods on similar tables, Understanding the different markets that are targeted by the company etc.

## Step 3 : Data Cleaning and ETL
Power BI is used for the first time in the project during this step.
The model view was understood to follow the star schema using Power BI. 
Apart from this, data cleaning was succesffully performed. For example, transactions where the sales amount if 0 or less than 0 were successfully removed, 
sales amounts not in INR were successfully converted.

## Step 4 : Building Dashboard
This is the most crucial step of the project, where the successful visualization of useful results is done. 
Some of the visualizations which could prove useful to customers and managers were built successfully. This includes revenue, sales quantity, 
revenue trend, top customers of the company and so on. 

## Step 5 : Publishing a Report
In this step, report was published using Power BI based on the results that were got. This step could seem small, but has a big part. 
Post publishing of report, the visualizations and important results got in Power BI could be viewed from any device, even if it does not have Power BI.
This could help managers to view the results from anywhere and help data analysts to make modifications as per the requirements.

## Step 6 : Viewing Dashboard in Mobile App
With this step, the user could view the visualizations and results built by him or her on their mobile device. This could be done by installing the Power BI 
app on mobile and logging into the account.

Overall, this project is a great way to start off in Power BI and SQL for anyone who wants to get into data analytics. That being said, the project always has
scope for improvements, with feedback from other users having a major say in the same.
